# angular-site-v3.0

This is the third itteration,a nd second deployment of my AngularJS website.

The purpose of this webpage was initially to get practice building a webpage with AngularJS and associated technologies; jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap.

This website will serve as a place to showcase the same information that would be found on a resume, in a more interesting way.

It can be easily modified to fit any individual as well.  The javascript file located in Webcontent/js/app/stub_data.js contains all the json objects that populate the page.

# exceptions

The only exception to the easy of manipulation would be a few of the associated image files.

- All images will go in the WebContent/images/ directory.
- Header image path is stored in WebContent/html/templates/reusable/page-header/index.html
- About me pictures are kept in WebContent/images/about-pics
    + The larger version of these pics are kept in WebContent/images/about-pics/big and must have the same name and exstension as their thumbnail counterparts.
